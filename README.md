# README Generator
  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GitHub-blue.svg)

## Description
     This is code I wrote for generating a ReadMe markdown file. I wanted to create this generator to use with future repositories, to create verbose, elegant README's for every project I work on. This generator was created using Javascript, Node.js File System with Inquirer.  I learned many things about what makes a good Readme in general and also gained experience with Node.js.  This generator creates a license badge, contains links to my GitHub as well as Table of Contents links.
## Table of Contents

* [Questions](#questions)
## Installation
     Steps involved in making this generator were as follows...

     Step 1: Create my question prompt array for the command line.

     Step 2: Write a function to capture the answers from the command line

     Step 3: Use FileSystem to write a new file for my sample 'projectREADME'and pass the data in the linked markdown.js file that contains the generate markdown function

     Step 4: Set up the structure of the README with the generateMarkdown function

     Step 5: Create links within that function for the Table of Contents, the badge generator and a link to my GitHub

     Step 6: Test and tweak as needed

## Usage
     To use: Clone the repository and open the Develop folder.  From there you can open your command line and type 'node index.js'. Then you will go through a series of prompts for questions to apply to the README.

## Contributing
     I had help from my tutor, the teaching assistances' and fellow classmate.
## Tests
     Testing was done throughout the project to make sure functions were working correctly, and that the syntax for styling was done right, and to make sure all the links were working. 
## Questions
     My first question was...

     "How do I capture the command line input after creating the object array?

     then...

     "How do I pass that data in the generateMarkdown file?

     Once I had those, then my questions were....

     "How do I create links within a markdown file?

     and...

     "How do I get the badge icon to show up in the file?

     There were many more, but those were the main ones.

     If you have any additional questions, please contact me by email.
